# TERM-CLOCK
by Aiden James

This is a simple terminal clock I am making to run on a raspberry pi. I decided on a bash script because I can't imagine not being able to run it on something I want it to run on. For now it gets the weather in Charlotte, NC. I may add some flags for different areas with the weather.
