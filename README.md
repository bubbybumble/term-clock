# TERM-CLOCK
by Aiden James

This is a simple terminal clock I am making to run on a raspberry pi. I decided on a bash script because I can't imagine not being able to run it on something I want it to run on. For now it gets the weather in Charlotte, NC every four hours. I may add some flags for different areas with the weather.

## Usage
Right now, simply run ./clock.sh, and when you want to close it, do ctrl+c as you would to close any program on the terminal.
